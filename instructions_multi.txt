Add support to the service a multi server mechanism.  This will allow a number of service instances to be started on different computers.  Each service is connected to all other services.  When a client publishes a message to its service that message is published to all the other service instances.  Care should be taken to ensure that when a service replicates such a message to another service that that service does not attempt to then replicate that message to other service instances.
